    <Step title="Booking Calender is Sent to User">
        Once enabled, your chatbot can offer meeting scheduling to users:

        1. When a user requests to book a meeting or appointment (e.g., "I'd like to book a meeting", "Book meeting", "Schedule appointment"), the chatbot recognizes this intent.
        2. The chatbot immediately responds by presenting the Calendly booking interface directly within the chat window.
