At WebAgent.ai, we understand the importance of seamless communication between your chatbot and website visitors. To ensure uninterrupted conversations, we're excited to offer a solution that provides unlimited AI-generated messages.

## **Standard Message Credits**

Each subscription plan comes with a set amount of AI-generated messages your chatbot can send within a 30-day window. For example, our Starter Plan includes 2000 message credits. However, we don't want you to worry about running out of credits mid-conversation.

## **Integrate Your OpenAI API Key for Unlimited Messages**

Here's the good news: you can unlock unlimited AI-generated messages by integrating your OpenAI API key with WebAgent.ai. Once you've exhausted your allocated message credits, we'll seamlessly switch over to use your API key, ensuring uninterrupted conversations with your website visitors.

## How to Get Started
