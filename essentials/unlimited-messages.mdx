## **Unlimited Messages with OpenAI API Key**

Each subscription plan comes with a set amount of AI-generated messages your chatbot can send within a 30-day window. However, you can unlock unlimited AI-generated messages by integrating your OpenAI API key with WebAgent.ai. This way, you'll never run out of message credits mid-conversation. Once you've exhausted your allocated message credits, we'll seamlessly switch over to use your API key, ensuring uninterrupted conversations with your website visitors.
