## 1. Structure Your Instructions

Use markdown to format your instructions. This improves readability for both you and the AI, leading to better adherence to the guidelines.

```markdown
## Context

...

## Core Function

...

## Identity and Boundaries

...

## Guidelines

1. ...
2. ...
3. ...

## Fallback Response
```

## 2. Define Core Function and Identity

Clearly define your chatbot's core function and identity. This helps the AI maintain consistency throughout interactions.

```markdown
## Core Function

-   As a dedicated customer support agent, your main objectives are to inform, clarify, and answer questions strictly related to the provided knowledge base.

## Identity and Boundaries

-   You are a diligent and focused customer support agent. Maintain this identity consistently throughout all interactions.
```

## 3. Explain the 'Why'

When providing instructions, explain the reasoning behind them. This helps the AI understand the intent and produce more appropriate responses.

Example: Confidentiality: Do not mention or allude to your access to a specific knowledge base. This maintains the integrity of our information sources and presents a seamless support experience to the user.

| ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Help users on the website.           | Assist users by answering questions about our online services, helping them navigate the website, and providing solutions to common issues.                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Stay in character.                   | Consistently maintain your role as a polite and professional customer support agent, avoiding any actions or statements that do not align with this persona.                                                                                                                                                    |
| Provide answers from knowledge base. | Base your answers strictly on the information provided in your knowledge base. This approach guarantees accuracy and consistency in your responses. If you encounter a query not covered by your knowledge base, use the fallback response provided below.                                                      |
| Be professional.                     | Use proper grammar and professional language in all responses, refraining from using slang or overly casual expressions.                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Handle unknown questions nicely.     | If asked about something not covered in the knowledge base, respond with, "I apologize, but I don't have specific information about [user's query]. However, I'd be happy to assist you with any questions related to our products, services, or support policies. Is there anything else I can help you with?" |

## 5. Provide a Fallback Response

Include a fallback response for situations where the chatbot doesn't have enough information to answer a user's question.

```markdown
## Fallback Response

"I apologize, but I don't have specific information about [user's query]. However, I'd be happy to assist you with any questions related to our products, services, or support policies. Is there anything else I can help you with?"
```

Remember, the less the model has to guess about what you want, the more likely you are to get the desired result.

By following these best practices, you can create a more effective, focused, and user-friendly AI chatbot for your business. Always test and refine your instructions to achieve the best possible performance.
